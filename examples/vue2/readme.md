# Using this code example

## Installation

``` bash
npm i
```

## Starting dev server

``` bash
npm run dev
```

## Building to dist folder

``` bash
npm run build
```

## Tests

There are no tests for this particular example.Â Testing of all configuration variants for Vue 3 is started from the plugin's root folder. There is no need to write separate tests for Vue 2, since the vote-custom-icons-resolver plugin is set as a parameter of the vite-plugin-components module and does not contain code specific to Vue 2.
